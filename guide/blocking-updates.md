HENkaku only runs on 3.60, therefore it's important to not update further.

If you previously set your DNS when updating to 3.60 and haven't changed it since, you don't need to follow this step.

## Instructions

1. Open the Settings application
2. Select **Network > Wi-Fi Settings > Advanced Settings > DNS Settings**
	- Make sure you are connected to the internet
	- Make sure **Proxy Server** is set to **Do Not Use**
3. Choose **Manual**
4. Change your **Primary DNS** to `212.47.229.76`
5. Change your **Secondary DNS** to `212.47.229.76`
6. Go back to the main Settings screen
7. Go to **System > Auto-Start Settings**
8. Uncheck **Download Update File for System Software**
